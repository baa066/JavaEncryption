												Java Encryption and Decryption Program Project Proposal
	
	For our project, our team has elected to create a Java encryption/decryption mechanism as our term project. 
	
	Our program will include the following features and subsets:
	
	Ability for the user to easily encrypt a file
	Ability to decrypt a file that have been encrypted
	Usage of the AES/ECB/PKCS7Padding algorithm for file encryption 1, 2
	Usage of a 256-bit AES symmetric key for encryption/decryption 3
	The bit-size of the AES cipher key is determined by the number of repetitive transformations that are performed 
	on the plaintext to convert it into the final ciphertext output (for encryption), or vice versa (for decryption).
	
	Our program will use the highest level of encryption – 256-bit AES – which will require 14 cycles of repetitive 
	transformations performed to the plaintext message or ciphertext.
	Dynamic Encryption 4
	Our program will have the ability to dynamically encrypt or decrypt, in real-time, a string of text or ciphertext.
