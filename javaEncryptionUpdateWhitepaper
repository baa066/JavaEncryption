                                                  Project Update
	For our project, our team had elected to create a Java encryption/decryption mechanism as our term project.
	Between the time of our project proposal submittal and now, we have successfully accomplished the ability to write a program that prompts the user with the menu below, giving the user two options: 
	1. Encrypt a string, or 2. Decrypt a string.
	 
	 Code:  
	 Would you like to 1. Encrypt or 2. Decrypt
  
  At this point, we are able to encrypt files (option 1) through the useage of a specific, AES, 128-bit key and cipher. 
  We have some bugs in the decryption portion of our program, however. 
  We are now working on resolving this issue as our main goal for the project.
	Below is a screenshot of our encryption program.
	  Code:
	  Would you like to 1. Encrypt or 2. Decrypt
	  1
	  Hello there
